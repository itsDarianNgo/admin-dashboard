## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, React, Material-UI,  Nivo Charts

## Optimizations
Admin Dashboard is still a work in progress and I've listed some features/optimizations I am working on below:

- Reorganize grid components in "src/scenes/dashboard" so it is less messy
- Use WellDatabase API or Corva API to get real data instead of mock data
- Add authentication
- Add MongoDB for user storage
- Add calendar for event tracking
- Add ability to create workflows

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
